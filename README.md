A full stack Voting dApp designed for Ethereum

# Full Stack Voting dApp

Welcome to the Full Stack Voting dApp repository! This project represents a significant milestone in my journey to learn about decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. Developed during a Solidity bootcamp, this dApp demonstrates my proficiency in building end-to-end blockchain-based voting systems.

## Overview

- **Tech Stack:** Angular, Solidity, Ethereum
- **Objective:** Create a secure and transparent voting system using blockchain technology.

## Features

This Full Stack Voting dApp incorporates a range of features, highlighting its capabilities and demonstrating my learning outcomes:

- **User-Friendly Interface:** A sleek and intuitive interface built with Angular, making it easy for voters to participate in elections.
- **Secure Voting:** Utilizes smart contracts written in Solidity to ensure secure and tamper-proof voting processes.
- **Transparent Results:** Results of elections are transparently recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring the integrity of the voting system.
- **Immutable Ledger:** Once a vote is cast, it's recorded on the blockchain, making the system immutable and resistant to fraud.
- **Scalability:** Designed to accommodate multiple elections, scaling to meet the needs of various voting scenarios.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/full-stack-voting-dapp.git
   cd full-stack-voting-dapp
   npm install
   ng serve


## Acknowledgments

This project was created as part of my journey to understand and implement blockchain technology. I'm grateful to the Solidity bootcamp for providing me with the knowledge and inspiration to develop this full stack voting dApp.
